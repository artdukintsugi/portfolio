# Personal portfolio 
My personal portfolio/website designed for the sole purpose to show what I can do or what I've already done.

## Used technologies
Whole website is build using Next.js and TailwindCSS. The decision to use Next.js was made mainly for the purpose for easier routing. However, TailwindCSS was used to it's absolute maximum even though someone would for sure argue that using `@apply` should be illegal when working with Tailwind.

## Overview
As my biggest coding project so far I will make sure to maintain it and display only the relevant stuff there. The design is also work in progress and will definitely improve that in the future.
